                Welcome to Green GetAway! Many people are unaware of the HUNDREDS of national parks located throughout the U.S. 
                Here at Green Getaway, we believe that it's important for all of us to remove ourselves from the hustle and 
                bustle of modern life from time to time, and to get back to nature. National Parks are great places to do this! Use our site to find a park
                near your next travel destination, or maybe even discover one in your home state that you were unaware of. 
                Whatever your reason may be, we believe there's a park for everyone. So get searchin', get prepared, and GetAway!
